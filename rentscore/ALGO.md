Let's pretend you've rented a place and your landlord sets a specific day each month by which you should pay your rent.

Your timeliness and completeness when paying rent generate a 'rental payment score'

Which can be thought of as how trustworthy you are with rent payments.

Here's how  payment behavior is translated into this score:

**Factors Impacting Your Score:**
1. The day of the month the landlord expects to be payed
2 .The portion of your rent you pay (full or partial).
3. The date you actually pay compared to the expected payment date set by your landlord.

**Scoring Rent Payments Based on Timeliness:**
For each payment made,
- Pay in full up to 5 days before the expected date, and you hit the top score of 10.
- Pay the complete rent amount between 1 to 5 days after the expected date, you'll score an 8.
- Complete your payment between 6 to 15 days after the expected date, and your score will be 6.
- If you pay in full 16 to 20 days after the expected date, you get a score of 5.
- Settling the entire rent 21 to 30 days late? That earns a score of 3.
- Any payment made after 30 days past the expected date is regarded as overdue, giving you a score of 0 for that payment.

**Calculating Partial Payment Scores:**
- Not paying the full rent at once doesn't disqualify you from earning points.
- Whatever amount you do pay will be evaluated proportionally based on when you paid it.
- For example, if your rent is Ksh 30,000 and you pay Ksh 15,000 five days late, you'll calculate the score for a full payment five days late (which is 8), then multiply it by the fraction of rent paid (which is 0.5). So, your score would be 8 * 0.5 = 4 in this scenario.

**Prepayments (Paying Before the Expected Date):**
- Paying before the expected date always works in your favor.
- Pay the full rent early and you effortlessly lock in a score of 10.
- If you make a half prepayment before the expected date, you'd receive points proportional to what you've paid, so half the rent early equals a score of 5.

**Dealing with Late Payments:**
- Late payments will not contribute positively to your score.
- If you clear your rent after the new monthly cycle has started, that payment's score will be a 0.
- Any payment made beyond 30 days past the due date is labeled as overdue and consistently scores a 0.

**Determining Your Risk Level:**

Over 24 months, the maximum achievable score of 240 points (assuming perfect payments each month).

Based on your cumulative score, your payment reliability falls into one of three categories:

- Low risk: a score of 158 - 240, which means you are usually on time with your rent.
- Moderate risk: a score of 98 - 157, indicating occasional lateness or partial payments.
- High risk: a score of 0 - 97, signaling frequent late or incomplete payments.

The goal is to pay on time and in full to maintain a high score, which signals your reliability as a tenant.
If you have unpaid rent by the end of the 24-month evaluation period.
